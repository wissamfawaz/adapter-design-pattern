# Your Location-Based Reminder

The Location-Based Meeting Reminder application  aims to ensure that users
 never arrive late to an event by sending a reminder 10 minutes prior leaving for a set meeting based on the user's current location, the set destination and factors that may cause delay on the road.  Tardiness and traffic
  come together to create a common issue we face on a daily
   basis. Therefore, the application at hand was created to resolve arriving late to the designated appointment.
